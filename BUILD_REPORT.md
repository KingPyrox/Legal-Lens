## Technical Debt & Considerations

### Security
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Add input sanitization
- Configure CORS properly for production
- Implement API key management

### Performance
- Add caching layer with Redis
- Optimize database queries
- Implement pagination
- Add request/response compression

### Monitoring
- Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- Add APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- Configure structured logging
- Implement health checks

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start Docker services
cd infra && docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
cd packages/database && npx prisma migrate dev

# Seed database
cd packages/database && npm run db:seed

# Start development servers
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Environment Setup Required

Before running the application, ensure you have:
1. Node.js 18+ installed
2. Docker and Docker Compose installed
3. Created a `.env` file from `.env.example`
4. Configured at least:
   - DATABASE_URL
   - JWT_SECRET
   - NEXTAUTH_SECRET

## Estimated Completion Time

Based on the PRD requirements and current progress:
- **API Implementation**: 2-3 days
- **Web Frontend**: 3-4 days
- **Mobile App**: 2-3 days
- **AI/ML Integration**: 2 days
- **Testing & Polish**: 2 days
- **Total**: ~12-15 days for MVP

## Compliance Checklist

- [x] Data model supports multi-tenancy
- [x] Audit logging table created
- [ ] GDPR data export endpoint
- [ ] Data deletion capabilities
- [ ] NOT LEGAL ADVICE disclaimers
- [ ] Privacy policy integration
- [ ] Cookie consent banner

## Production Readiness

Current readiness: **30%**

Remaining work:
- Complete API implementation
- Build frontend applications
- Integrate AI services
